1. run test_tool_initialize.m; 
        All necessary settings are in that file.
2. run test_tool_inport_map; 
        In this step, all variables are generated in the base workspace.
        The necessary signals prefixed with "test_sig" are generated. 
        Then, we need to map the generated signals to root input port. 
        Open Model Setting, choose Data Import/Export. 
        Select Connect Input, choose From WorkSpace. 
        Select all generated signals prefixed with "test_sig" in this UI. 
        In MAP TO MODEL section, click Port Order, In Options section, select Update Model. 
        Choose the left generated signals and click Map to Model. 
        The process will be automatically over. 
        Then, choose Mark for Simulation. 
        Save the files. 
3. run test_tool_loop.m;
        The testing procedure starts and will last for the specific time designed in test_tool_initialize.m;
